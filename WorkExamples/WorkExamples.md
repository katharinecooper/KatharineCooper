## Work Examples
Here are some work examples from previous class projects!

### Automating Business Processes

### Data Mining & Visualization
For the course project in this class, we combined what we learned in R, Tableau, and JMP. For my project, I chose to explore carbon dioxide emissions and what variables can be used to predict a state's carbon dioxide emissions.
