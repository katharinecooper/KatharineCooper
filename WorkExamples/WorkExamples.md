## Work Examples
Here are some work examples from previous class projects!

### Automating Business Processes 
In this class, we learned how to utilize Python to do statistical tests and create visualizations.

For this example, we wrote code to create a regression equation, tell the user the R-Squared value and P-value, and print a conclusion stating whether the null hypothesis can be accepted or rejected. [Code here](CandySimpleLinear.ipynb)

### Data Mining & Visualization
For the course project in this class, we combined what we learned in R, Tableau, and JMP. For my project, I chose to explore carbon dioxide emissions and what variables can be used to predict a state's carbon dioxide emissions.
