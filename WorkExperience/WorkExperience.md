Currently, I work as a part-time gymnastic coach. I've done gymnastics since I was 5 years old and have worked at the gym for about 6 years. Although I haven't used or learned any technical skills from this job, I have gained many soft skills such as communication, time management, conflict resolution, leadership, problem-solving, and empathy.
