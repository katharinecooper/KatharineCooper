## Work Experience
Currently, I'm looking for a summer internship in analytics. Previously, I've worked as a part-time gymnastics coach. I've done gymnastics since I was 5 years old and  worked at the gym for about 6 years. Although I haven't used or learned any technical skills from this job, I have gained many soft skills such as communication, time management, conflict resolution, leadership, problem-solving, and empathy. The skills I learned from this job are skills that I will take with me throughout my career in addition to the knowledge I've gained during my time at the University of Denver.
